# STAT 545A MINI DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT - HEHAN (ZOE) ZHANG

This repository is for Zoe Zhang's mini-data analysis project. My project is looking at the data on apartment buildings, aiming to find the relationships between built years, number of units, storeys and property types.

There are three folders in this repository (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, and output): 

Milestone 1: contains the.Rmd and .md files for milestone 1, mini-data analysis project.

Milestone 2: contains the.Rmd and .md files for milestone 2, mini-data analysis project.

output folder: outputs created from Task 4 in Milestone 2, which is a .csv file of one of the summarized tables in Milestone 2 that summarize apartment built year in different eras, with a linear regression model saved as an .rds file.
